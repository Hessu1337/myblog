I wanted something simple, using github and aws, a simple workflow : write then push
For the experience and knowledge

Github for code versionning and webhook
Codebuild for the build environnement and Codepipeline as CI/CD tool
S3 as deployment target and static hosting
Cloudfront for CDN and HTTPS terminaison
